    <p class="t--bold c--secondary">Valid reasons for a refund include:</p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>You didn't have time to go through the course, so it was a bad investment...</li>

      <li>You don't really like the way in which I teach... (pretty unlikely if you liked the emails, btw)</li>

      <li>You tried the system I suggested, but for some reason it doesn't work in your market...</li>

      <li>You buy it, but the next month you're super tight on cash. You decide you need the money back in order to pay the bills...</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="space">I hope you are willing to invest in your future, and make a "ballsy move" by getting into Elite, today. And if you ever come to regret this purchase... you can claw your money back, easily.</p>

    <p>Now...</p>
