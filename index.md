how_it_works:
  - "**Build systems** for durable, scalable pathways to growth"
  - "**A structural, long-term partner**, rather than hiring freelancers on project-based stuff"
  - "**Qualified experts** on fields from paid ads to copywriting, and sales funnels to analytics"
  - "**A fast, iterative approach** with a cadence of high-tempo adjustments & experimentation"
  - '**We take full ownership over your growth**—as your Head of Growth we’ll do whatever is needed to hit your growth targets… even if some of that work is technically not “marketing”'
