      <p><b>Hi there, Caspar here.<br>
      Let me try to explain what goes wrong and how to fix it</b></p>
      <p>Our platform runs on cookies, if you have the correct cookie (which you get once you buy our program), it'll let you login, otherwise the page just refreshes.</p>
      <p>Now sometimes, something goes wrong and you get the wrong cookies. Now even logging in with the correct email address is not going to let you in (extra security measures).</p>
