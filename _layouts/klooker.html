                <h3><b>How we got people to care</b></h3>
                <p> When we got to know Klooker, they were just starting up. A founder and a remote dev team looking for marketing help. At the start Klooker was heading for an on-demand e-commerce platform, trying to build a personal shopper for your day to day products. </p>

                <p>
                Although this was too big of a dream to realize, Klooker managed to reinvent itself. From personal shopper to personal eco-lifestyle assistant. Establishing itself in the competitive sustainability market, Klooker managed to acquire 2000+ paying subscribers and start in 3 countries in its first year!</p>

                <h3>What we've learned</h3>
                <p>
                Klooker is now profitable, with 3500+ paying subscribers, and a steady growing user base. We're proud that we've helped Dennis build this from the ground up and is now helping thousands of people live a more conscious and sustainable life.</p>
                <p>
                This was not always the case. One of the major things we learned from working with Klooker was the importance of focus. Focusing on the right things vs the wrong ones can make all the difference between success and failure.</p>
                <p>
                In the case of Klooker, the focus was too much at perfecting the product, at the start. When we made the pivot, we've shifted the focus completely towards testing. By starting with only a barebones (idea of a) product, we could test (and change) the messaging, pricing, branding and even the very core of the product itself to align with our customers wishes.</p>
