                <p> Besides our course, we've been helping out startups from many different industries. This has been an enlightening and awesome experience and it really helped me to become better at explaining the Growth Marketing to people.
                <br>
                Because I don't like to keep things to myself, I thought that everyone could use a little help. That's why I added a consulting module to Elite, in which I try to explain how <i>you</i> can use Elite to help startups reach sustainable growth!

                The lessons in the module include:
                <ol>
                  <li> Consulting introduction: The main concepts </li>
                  <li> Positioning: How to position yourself in the market</li>
                  <li> etc. </li>
                </ol>
