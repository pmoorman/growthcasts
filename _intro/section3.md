After watching that video on Reddit, I started messing around with the things they do: I tested the way they structure their funnels. I "reverse-engineered" the way they build traffic systems (called “growth engines”). I started applying their ruthless testing and prioritisation regimes.

After a while I started to notice their channel strategies. The psychological triggers they pull. The copywriting. (Slack. Holy shit.  Mind-blowing).

But I always had one simple objective in mind...

“Can I turn their strategies into something that a dummy like myself can execute?”

Fast-forward 2 years, and see what we have:

{: .list}
- There's a simple, 7-part framework that we execute
- Over the years, they have been tried and tested.
- I have — as a consultant — been able to help 3 startups scale incredibly well (1 to acquisition, 1 to raise Series A, 2 to profitability)
- A few friends of mine started using this system… and they got great results, too.

Now it’s even turned into a new, flagship product (called “Growthcasts Elite”), that every entrepreneur can us himself, to learn these skills!
