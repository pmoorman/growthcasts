    **For MeterInsight, we suggest to start with the 10 hours/week sprint package** for start of the project and scale up when more executionally heavy tasks are required (content generation, sales, etc.).

            MeterInsight builds bespoke data science solutions on their no-code platform TimeSeriesXL, together with partnered data science consultancies. These solutions, like LeakInsight and EnergyInsight, can be re-used and sold to any other interested party.

            In 2021, MeterInsight wishes to increase the number of customers serviced through TimeSeriesXL, as well as their existing solutions. To reach these results, they need to scale up the sales and marketing efforts and to bring their business to the next stage of maturity.

            MeterInsight is looking for a partner that can help position the brand and scale up their marketing and sales operations. Double is the right long-term partner to assist the current team in growing MeterInsight into an internationally recognized brand.

            To pave the way for national and later international expansion, we need to find scalable ways to reach and convert (1) customers for the existing solutions in their respective industries and (2) data science and consultancy partners to build and sell more solutions.

            While the MeterInsight brand is getting a make-over by Studio Rocket Power, we can already start designing the strategies and infrastructure to grow.

            We separated this into three workstreams:

      - type: list1
        data:
          items:
            - title: Brand positioning
              body: |
                In order to tell a straight story to our clients and partners, we need to revise our communication strategy to position the brands clear and strong.
            - title: Inbound Marketing
              body: |
                Generate a steady inbound lead stream and claim an authority position in the market.
            - title: Outbound & sales process
              body: |
                Set up outbound sales processes for TimeSeriesXL and apps.

            ### 1. Brand positioning
                
            We will create a fitting communication strategy that resonates with our audiences, by writing separate story angles for our different target audiences. Together we can structure these into one coherent story.

            Besides creating the main message, we will (re)write the copy for the website, emails and other necessary (sales) assets.

            While working on the positioning and communication we can collaborate with the branding agency to get the message and visual identity well aligned. 

            <br>
            ### 2. Inbound Marketing

            Once the TimeSeriesXL and other brands have successfully been positioned, we will identify best-performing inbound marketing channels to create a predictable lead flow. 
                
            Possible channels to test:
      - type: list2
        data:
          items:
            - title: Google Search Ads (PPC)
            - title: Content Marketing
            - title: PR
            - title: Social media marketing
            - title: Retargeting campaigns
            - title: LinkedIn Ads
      - type: text
        data:
          body: |
            Besides opening these channels, we can help create and distribute thought leadership content to gain a better authority and greater inbound lead flow.

            <br>
            ### 3. Outbound & sales process
            To compliment the inbound process, we can assist in the outbound lead generation and create a oiled sales machine:
      - type: list2
        data:
          type: numbers
          items:
            - title: Prospecting of new leads and outsourcing/automation
            - title: Set up a CRM system to structure sales process
            - title: Divide sales tasks and train sales reps
            - title: Create necessary assets and sales copy
