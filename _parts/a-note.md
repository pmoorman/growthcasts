Maybe that's a weird way to put it. Because it's a no-brainer:

{: .handwriting .handwriting--primary}
"Yes, of course you should!"

At $229, I know that the price of Growthcasts Elite might be a hurdle for you. It’s not the cheapest thing around! But if you break it down, it's only $19.08 per month (spread over 12 months).

{: .t--bold .c--black}
That's the price you’d pay for the lowest-tier plan of your typical SaaS too:

{: .list}
- Maybe your hosting costs $19 per month (probably more)
- Maybe your email marketing provider costs $19/month (probably much more)
- Maybe your project management app costs $19/month
- Maybe your bug-tracking software costs $19/month

But it feels differently, doesn't it? You buy those tools in a heartbeat... because you know your business simply needs them.

So here's the question again...

{: .handwriting .handwriting--primary}
Should you invest $19/month to learn how to acquire more customers?

I don't know much about your business... but if you have ANY of the tools above... then probably you should!Imagine you look back in a year from now...

{: .t--bold .c--black}
Would $19 really be a significant thing in your monthly expense statement?

Probably not. But just imagine...
