    - title: Acquisition
      content: |
        We love using data-driven campaigns to drive traffic… whether that’s with  paid ads, outbound sales, content marketing, you name it.
    - title: Marketing infrastructure
      content: |
        Many companies struggle to understand what’s working and what isn’t, because analytics, attribution and data-driven marketing are confusing. It’s a good thing then, that we completely geek out on it.
    - title: Story-driven sales funnels
      content: |
        The next step is giving exceptional value to all that traffic, for free (sprinkled with tempting sales copy, of course) and turning them into new customers.
    - title: Modern growth strategies
      content: |
        Growing in the internet age depends on seeing marketing through a new lens. We own the Growth Loops methodology - architecting, executing and teaching it.
process:
  items:
    - title: Our focus is building systems
    - title: We do that via an iterative approach called high-tempo testing
    - title: Once the system is running smoothly, we help you operate it in-house
    - title: As needed, we can engage in parallel workstreams
      content: |
        (i.e. simultaneously building your sales funnels + improving branding)
