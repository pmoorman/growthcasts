<p class="lead">
Over in little Belgium, Elugie is leading the charge for sustainable energy.
Instead of waiting for large power companies and governments to innovate, they’re flipping the electricity model on its head. How?
</p>

### They’ve created personal hydrogen power plants that can be installed in every home and business.
Elugie came to us after selling around 400 of them. They knocked on our door and said, *“We’re on a mission to sell 100,000 of these by 2030”*.

### That meant shedding the startup skin

At this point, Elugie was still leveraging their founder’s skills to close new deals. While it’s a powerful early-stage sales strategy to lean on a founder’s credibility, it eventually creates a bottleneck. One person can only be in so many places at once.

We suggested creating automated marketing funnels to unlock scalable growth. When Elugie gave us the green light, we started our research...



### And hit a wall

Selling 100,000 power plants by 2030 suddenly looked **very** unlikely.
Elugie had correctly identified butcheries and bakeries as heavy electricity consumers. But, because bakers and butchers were, on-average, 53 years old, these shop owners were likely to retire before seeing a return on their investment!

### The fix

Together, we pivoted. The property owners leasing buildings to bakers and butchers looked to be better target customers. So we focussed on them and built out emails, webinar scripts and case studies.

With new funnels to nurture prospects **without** manual input... Elugie was ready to scale.
