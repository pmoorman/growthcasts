<p class="lead">
Alpian is the rising neobank created specifically to serve Switzerland’s “mass affluent”. These are busy professionals with savings of around CHF 100’000 (~USD $100,000), who lack the time and expertise to invest.
</p>


Alpian provides them with what are essentially private banking services - all from an app. Clients can access a range of investment services, depending on their goals, alongside personal banking. 

Roman Balzan, Alpian’s CMO, connected with us through our Growth Marketing email course. We must have made an impression because soon we were in on his mission to acquire a solid base of leads prior to the app’s launch in 12 months.

We built and executed a strategy including **performance advertisements, content nurturing funnels, and inbound marketing.**

## Our Strategy

With Alpian bringing a never-before-seen financial product to the market, there was a big job ahead to attract leads and nurture them for up to eight months prior to the launch.
Here’s how we went about it.

### Performance ads + gifting exceptional knowledge 

On paper, Alpian’s executive team is nothing less than impressive. Each member carries a track record packed with impossible-not-to-know brands and clear wins. What better way, then, to attract wealthy professionals, than by sharing hard-earned secrets?

We interviewed Alpian’s Head of investments and packaged his investing principles into ‘The Masterclass’ - a free email education translated into all of Switzerland’s major languages. We designed it to provide everything an amateur needs to begin.

With the course pushed across paid and organic channels - LinkedIn, Google, and Facebook - we set our sights on staying top-of-mind with prospects between the end of the course and the app launch.

### Webinars, AMAs, and contextualised insights

Why would one investment be an excellent idea for an engineer in his 20s, and a mistake for a real estate agent in her 50s?
The nuances of investment are the favourite topic of Alpian’s team. So, to engage the database of newly-educated leads, we focussed on building a platform for sharing these nuances to train our prospects’ critical thinking.

Through biweekly emails, webinars, and scheduled Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions, the team analysed both current events and macro topics like inflation.

That brings us to today. As the app’s launch grows nearer, we will soon introduce Alpian’s customer team to the audience in webinars of their own.

### Conclusion

Alpian is now equipped with automated nurturing systems that will serve them both before and after the app’s launch. The infrastructure allows them to modify and add to their content (a second season of ‘The Masterclass’ is set to launch), as well as repurpose much of the content for their organic social media strategy.

From here, our role will focus on monitoring and optimising each system. Are there new channels to target? New offers to make? And how can this nurturing flow into a seamless onboarding?

Exciting times ahead!
