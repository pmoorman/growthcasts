<p class="lead">
Over in Belgium- Elugie is leading the charge towards sustainable energy. Instead of waiting for large power companies and governments to innovate, Elugie flipped the electricity model on its head.

They did this by manufacturing personal hydrogen power plants the size of dishwashers, that can be installed in homes and businesses.
Elugie approached us after selling approximately 400 power plants, and their mission was clear: “We want to sell 100,000 of these by 2030”. 

Ambitious? Very much so.

### Our Strategy

When we did a little digging into Elugie’s business strategy, we found they were targeting the wrong customers for exponential, long-term growth-. This caused scalability to be a challenge.

Elugie sold their power plants to bakers and butchers with high energy demands, who were, on-average, 53 years old. This meant most of them wouldn’t see a return on their investment before retiring, which made contracts harder to close.

To address this- we planned on conducting market research, which would help uncover a more profitable segment to target instead.

### Research and Insights

After identifying this acquisition bottleneck, we got to work.
We interviewed existing, and potential customers, and ranked them on the following:

1. Propensity to take risks
2. Average age
3. Main motivations for purchase. 

After the data was collected, we studied these answers in combination with calculations of the average customer lifetime value and market size. 

### Together, we pivoted. 

The research uncovered that selling directly to property owners leasing buildings to bakers and butchers, was the most lucrative option. 

With our new target audience identified- we built out: email sequences, webinar scripts, and case studies, which focused on addressing the challenges and motivations of property owners. Elugie’s products were then positioned as the only logical solution to their energy consumption troubles. 

### Conclusion

Our team helped Elugie take a step back before moving forward. While trying to crack the ‘acquisition’ code, we found ourselves needing answers to bigger, business-related questions first like, who should we sell to? Targeting a different audience helped Elugie move away from that manual work and set them up on a track to explosive growth.
