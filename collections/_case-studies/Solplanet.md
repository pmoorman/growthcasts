<p class="lead">
Solplanet (by AISWEI) has a mission to bring solar to everyone. They’re bringing it to life by building innovative inverters that are so easy to install, customers can do it blindfolded.

When Solpanet brought us in to design a market-entry strategy, we focussed on one thing: becoming a customer-centric brand.

### The power of listening

To launch successful online awareness campaigns, we profiled Solplanet’s ideal customer in each of their target markets. Then, we took time to define Unique Selling Points (USPs) and optimal messaging.

It meant that when the day came to go live, it wasn’t long before the leads were *flowing* in.

From here, it was then time to focus on stage 2: acquisition. To build Solplanet’s authority in the market, we recommended a focus on beyond-excellent customer support, and a company culture for *embracing user feedback*. They’ve embraced the strategy and right now, Solplanet is active in seven countries and launching in more. They’re a testament to the fact that actively listening to your end-users almost always gives you the edge!
