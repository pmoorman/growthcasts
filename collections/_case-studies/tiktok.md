<p class="lead">
With 500 million monthly active users, a company value of 100 billion and 15,000 employees… TikTok is the leading platform for short-form mobile video.

But when TikTok’s platform exploded, the company’s B2B branch fell behind. They weren’t onboarding new advertisers fast enough to stay on target, and couldn’t see what was causing the holdup.

### From corporate to agile

We did a marketing audit, and found that TikTok was approaching new partners with corporate-style communications. Based on our copywriting knowledge, there was no doubt that this was the issue.

We helped TikTok shift to segmented, automated sales funnels that delivered personalised messages to different customer types. Then, we tested variations at a rapid pace to hone in on the optimal approach.

### Standing by...

After building landing pages, an email marketing strategy, whitepapers, and even GIFs, we stuck around to troubleshoot any technical marketing dramas.

And that’s where we are now. TikTok calls us their *go-to marketing task force*.
