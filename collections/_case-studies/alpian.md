Alpian is the Swiss neobank for busy professionals.

Their app puts personal banking, investments, and advice all at their clients' fingertips, and we've been helping Alpian connect with those clients since they landed their series B funding...

### Systems based marketing

For Alpian to grow sustainably, they needed an **automated** user acquisition process with the potential to scale independently of their employee count.

In action, that meant building an email masterclass that educated, nurtured and converted leads on autopilot, before turning them into happy customers with an onboarding flow.

Once the user-conversion engine was ready, all that was left was driving traffic to it with paid ads and content marketing. If you’d like to know how it’s going, then you can sharpen up your investing skills at the same time by checking out their masterclass, *i-vest*.
