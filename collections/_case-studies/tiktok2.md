## Escaping the early-startup plateau

<p class="lead">
With over 600 million monthly active users, a company value of 400 billion and 15,000 employees… TikTok is the leading platform for short-form mobile video.

But when TikTok’s platform exploded, the company’s B2B branch fell behind. They weren’t onboarding new advertisers fast enough to stay on target, and couldn’t see what was causing the holdup.

It turned out that solving this by opting for plain old corporate-style communications, wasn’t going to do the trick. TikTok knew that their ‘for business’ platform was ready for more personalisation, excellent design, and smoothly-automated sales funnels.

But with such ambitions, comes complexity.

### Great emails that do the heavy lifting

The intention was there, then came the time for implementation. 
Our team started off by re-thinking, re-writing, and re-designing email campaigns directed at advertisers. To be able to scale these efforts further, we also built high-performing re-usable email templates. 

For smooth sailing during the growth of their B2B branch, we made sure to integrate  every tool used by TikTok to manage and communicate with its advertisers. 

Our team took the request to steer clear of ‘just-good-enough’ communication seriously. We collaborated with our in-house animators and designers to build GIFS and interactive elements for some additional spice. 

Want to see an example? We thought you’d never ask: 


## Design that pops for better lead generation 

With most of the technical hurdles around email marketing out of the way, it was time to tackle TikTok’s lead generation machine. In the same way we thought about nurturing existing advertisers, we walked through every step of the customer journey. 

This led to our designing a series of landing pages directed at new advertisers interested in joining TikTok for Business. These played an important role in setting up their inbound marketing efforts. We’re pretty proud of this one. 


### Retention, retention, retention

So what are we up to now? 

When talks started around retention, we soon understood that, just like its users, advertisers on TikTok are there for different reasons. Some want to get their brand name out within a specific audience, while others are ready to start using TikTok as their main channel for growth. 

Addressing these needs is what led to the creation of TikTok’s resources for advertisers. Using case studies and whitepapers to inform advertisers about possibilities and what to expect from the platform. 

To **boost** TikTok’s B2B activities, our team applied principles of systems-based marketing. Rather than relying on traditional marketing campaigns, we built lasting systems that drive growth. From customer acquisition, all the way to retention.
