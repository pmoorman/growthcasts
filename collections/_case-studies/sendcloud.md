<p class="lead">
Automation is Sendcloud’s game. By automating everything from checkouts to package tracking, they make shipping a breeze for over 15,000 Ecommerce stores.

What are the chances, then, that our automation-led marketing course might catch the eyes of Sendcloud’s CMO...

Tom got stuck into the Double Academy and came out the other side with what he saw as a game-changer: *Sendcloud could explode its sales by dialling in its copywriting*.

It made sense. Because his team was writing copy in more than six languages for products, email newsletters and the website, **any** incremental improvements would have a broad effect. That’s why he brought us into the office for a copywriting crash course.

### The “aha” moment

Mid-workshop, Sendcloud struck gold when we introduced a copy concept known around the world as creating a buying environment.

The team realized that they could use the technique to help potential customers see Sendcloud as a *branding opportunity*, rather than simply an expense.

Have they had success? Well, they’re growing so fast that we wouldn’t be surprised if you’ve already heard of them!
