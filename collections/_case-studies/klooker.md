Klooker was in its early days when we met. Their founder was working with a remote dev team to create an on-demand Ecommerce platform. It was an ambitious dream, given that the market was already packed with players like Google, Amazon and Ahold.

### Shopping platform turns eco-lifestyle assistant

Together we took the product concept through a roller coaster of market testing to make sure it was a perfect fit with an audience (instead of becoming a generalised competitor to the giants).

And that shaped Klooker as we know it today. Klooker is *an eco-lifestyle assistant that helps its customers find sustainable alternatives for mainstream products*. This altered offering has resonated enough to gather more than 2000 paying subscribers in its first year!

Now, Klooker is profitable and on track, with over 3500+ paying subscribers and a growing user base. Klooker’s story is a testament to the power of staying open-minded, and testing, testing, testing!
