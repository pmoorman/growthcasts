          To match the pace and competition in the global retail market, they need a more scalable and systematic approach to growth. In order to achieve this, they need to develop a growth model that relies on systems-thinking and leverages digital opportunities.

          Nordic Projekt has a strong team that focuses on brand awareness and sales, which can benefit perfectly from the growth-oriented, modern approach that Double has to offer.

          To enable and speed up international expansion, we need to find a scalable system that we can roll out, rinse and repeat in each new market we enter. By starting in one market we can find this repeatable template. Once this approach is validated, we can move towards unlocking new markets.

          We would need to work hand in hand with both marketing and sales departments to share current best practices and build out the growth system together with the team.

          There are three essential parts in every growth system:

          Although all Healthee Company brands in both B2B and B2C will require such a system, we'll start in B2B, Italian market for Nordic Projekt. Nordic Projekt already has a significant brand status and market share, it's possible to consider both outbound and inbound channels simultaneously.

          ### Outbound Lead Gen Engine

          To find qualified prospects and hand them over to the sales reps in an efficient way, there are three stages that need to be set up:

    - type: list2
      data:
        type: numbers
        items:
          - title: Prospecting
            body: |
              The process of locating places where your target audience is hanging out and finding their contact details to reach them. This part is easy to automate/outsource.
          - title: Outreach
            body: |
              Through multiple channels we can reach out to the potential leads. Most popular is LinkedIn, but I think cold emailing and calling can also be very successful.
          - title: Qualification
            body: |
              This is the stage where we need to hand-off the highly qualified leads to the actual sales representatives. These 'reps’ are in the business of relationship building and closing. The prior stages must be done by someone else the reps to keep them focused.

          ### Inbound Lead Gen engine

          For inbound lead generation there are many options. It is key to prioritise the channels and set up experiments to find the ones that are worth investing in. This part of the growth system relies much on the branding of the company, since conversion and channels performance depend on the status of the brand.

          Inbound lead generation can be divided into two separate stages:

    - type: list2
      data:
        items:
          - title: Awareness
            body: |
              Creating awareness can be done through multiple channels, like content marketing, SEO, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, PR, organic SM.
          - title: Conversion
            body: |
              Conversion happens mostly on the website, or by leads emailing directly. Every possible route from first exposure to first content must be as smooth as possible.

          ### Sales Process

          Although the sales process in a traditional market heavily depends on the inner workings of the sales team, there are a few areas that can benefit from a more growth oriented approach.

    - type: list2
      data:
        items:
          - title: Systemised sales process
            body: |
              All lead generation efforts must find a good alignment with sales, to ensure a structure that incentivises available talent as effectively as possible.
          - title: Persuasive email marketing
            body: |
              Most sales departments forget to add clients to their email lists to share relevant content and don't keep them warm until it's time to close.
          - title: Retargeting strategies
            body: |
              Retargeting is most popular in B2C businesses, but are under-appreciated by B2B businesses. They provide the perfect reminder and brand building to close the sale.

          ### Retention & Referral

          The purpose of the last system is to create brand ambassadors and returning customers. Although the quality of the products is key, there are a few marketing strategies that aid customer retention and referral.

    - type: list1
      data:
        items:
          - title: CRM
            body: |
              On-point content and personal communication with the current B2B customer base.
          - title: Referral strategies
            body: |
              By creating sharable assets and supply partners with many test products, customers can recommend your products to others. This typically works well in traditional, non-competitive markets.
          - title: B2B → B2C loops
            body: |
              By engaging customers with nice product extras and consumer CRM, you create power users that will return for upsells and returning purchase. Extra engagement with sharable content, product experience and sharing schemes will create brand ambassadors that bring in new customers for free.
