          MeterInsight builds bespoke data science solutions on their no-code platform TimeSeriesXL, together with partnered data science consultancies. These solutions, like LeakInsight and EnergyInsight, can be re-used and sold to any other interested party.

          In 2021, MeterInsight wishes to increase the number of customers serviced through TimeSeriesXL, as well as their existing solutions. To reach these results, they need to scale up the sales and marketing efforts and to bring their business to the next stage of maturity.
          
          MeterInsight is looking for a partner that can help position the brand and scale up their marketing and sales operations. Double is the right long-term partner to assist the current team in growing MeterInsight into an internationally recognized brand.

          To pave the way for national and later international expansion, we need to find scalable ways to reach and convert (1) customers for the existing solutions in their respective industries and (2) data science and consultancy partners to build and sell more solutions.

          While the MeterInsight brand is getting a make-over by Studio Rocket Power, we can already start designing the strategies and infrastructure to grow.

          ### 1. Brand positioning
              
          We will create a fitting communication strategy that resonates with our audiences, by writing separate story angles for our different target audiences. Together we can structure these into one coherent story.

          Besides creating the main message, we will (re)write the copy for the website, emails and other necessary (sales) assets.

          While working on the positioning and communication we can collaborate with the branding agency to get the message and visual identity well aligned. 

          <br>
          ### 2. Inbound Marketing

          Once the TimeSeriesXL and other brands have successfully been positioned, we will identify best-performing inbound marketing channels to create a predictable lead flow. 
              
          Possible channels to test:
    - type: list2
      data:
        items:
          - title: Google Search Ads (PPC)
          - title: Content Marketing
          - title: PR
          - title: Social media marketing
          - title: Retargeting campaigns
          - title: LinkedIn Ads
    - type: text
      data:
        body: |
          Besides opening these channels, we can help create and distribute thought leadership content to gain a better authority and greater inbound lead flow.

          <br>
          ### 3. Outbound & sales process
          To compliment the inbound process, we can assist in the outbound lead generation and create a oiled sales machine:
    - type: list2
      data:
        type: numbers
        items:
          - title: Prospecting of new leads and outsourcing/automation
