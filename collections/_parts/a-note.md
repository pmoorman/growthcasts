**And it has to be…** because startups don’t have a lot of money. So you need to be resourceful. Creative.

And the easiest way to be creative, is to find ways where product and marketing blend together. 

Where the early adopters of today draw in the next wave of users tomorrow.

Where feedback loops create durable ways to attract more traffic and leads.

Where your marketing is automated and ready to scale.  


### Being smarter about growth marketing has an immediate effect on your profitability & bottom line

- Better copywriting — immediately leads to more signups and higher conversions… (module 4, copywriting)
- Better retention — means you earn more money per user, and thus increase profits…  (module 5, retention)
- Better sales funnels — give you higher lead flow, with much less effort…  (module 2, sales funnels)
- Modern frameworks — like high-tempo testing allow you to experiment faster, and find strong product/market-fit…  (module 6, advanced strategy)

None of that requires massive investments.  
It's cheap. Ready for anyone to grab!
