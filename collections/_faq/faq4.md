faq:
- Which package should I buy?: >
    The price difference between the 2 packages is minimal. I did that for a reason: I want you to go in with all the bonus materials as well... because it helps you execute the strategies I lay out.<br><br>
    What you probably need more than anything else, is a clear step-by-step framework to execute... but also all the practical tips and tricks to make it happen. <br>
    <b>That's why all those bonuses are focused on helping you execute & implement:</b><br>
    - Over-my-shoulder tactical case study videos (13x, all in HD quality, about ~25 minutes each) <br>
    - Execution Manuals (PDF Guides, 7x) <br>
    - Worksheets<br>
    - Swipe files to copy from <br>
    - Cheatsheets - to see stuff like exactly which tools I use, etc.<br>
    - Treasure Vaults (full of additional resources)<br>
    - Personalised, 1-on-1 support from myself (over email & skype) <br><br>
    I think this should make it a no-brainer to buy the package with the bonuses... which is exactly what I had in mind!<br><br>
    <b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> You also get a massive, 365-days guarantee, no matter which package you buy.
- What is the refund policy?: >
    <b>My refund policy is really simple: if you don't like the product you can just get your money back (up till 365 days after you purchase).</b><br><br>
    Within this market, it's very common that people will offer you only a refund if you "do you homework", or something ridiculous like that. I don't want to do that. You can just get a refund if it's not a good fit, no matter what the reason was. <br><br>
    <b>Valid reasons for a refund include:</b><br>
    - You didn't have time to go through the course, so it was a bad investment... -> money' back<br>
    - You don't really like the way in which I teach... -> money back<br>
    - You tried the work, you skyped with me... but it all didn't work out -> money back<br>
    - You buy it, but the next month you're super short on cash. You decide it was an un-wise purchase given your financial situation... -> money back.<br><br>
    To get a refund, you can just email me at <b>pieter@double-agency.com</b>, and I'll take care of it myself. Because I use Gumroad, a refund takes up to 5 days to be executed and get back into your bank account.<br><br>
    <b>I hope you will give Elite the 'benefit of the doubt' and if you ever come to regret the fact that you took a bold action... then I'll just refund you.</b>
- For how long do I gain access?: >
    <b>There is no limit on this. You get access for life.</b><br><br>
    You also get lifetime access to future upgrades & improvements to the product. The last update I did was 2 months ago (as I write this), when I added 13 case study videos where I cover all kind of tactical nuts & bolts. This was a free update with almost 5 hours of extra free, practical video content.
- What's stopping you from buying Elite, right now? : >
    That's a question from ME, to you! <b>If there's anything still bothering you</b> in the back of your mind, I hope you send me an email at pieter@double-agency.com (so I can answer your specific question myself).<br><br>
    <b>If there's nothing really bothering you, but you're just undecided...</b><br>
    I hope you do a quick best-case/wost-case analysis... and you'll realise that there's almost nothing to loose (remember that 365-day refund-for-any-reason policy?), and a great deal to gain (potentially a business doing $20,000-50,000 per month in revenue, or even more).<br><br>
    I hope to see you on the inside in a few minutes!
