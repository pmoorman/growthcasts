faq:
- Who is this for?: >
    Growthcasts Elite is primarily focused on early-stage startups, with high-growth / high-impact ambitions.<br><br>
    Because the framework is quite universal, this approach works very well for both SaaS, mobile apps or eCommerce... but it works equally well for 'traditional' businesses, B2B startups or even non-profits.<br><br>
    People that buy Elite, typically fall in one the following 3 buckets:<br><br>
    <b>A) You’re a startup founder,</b> and you’d like to incorporate this kind of thing into your business —You want to stop doing traditional marketing, and instead start building “growth loops”. <br>
    <b>B) You want to start a business?</b> Even better: We will design your company like a loop from the start! <br>
    <b>C) You work for a startup (or as a consultant)</b>, and your team could use this kind of help. Maybe you want to sell growth marketing consultancy as a service (like I do, myself)
- Will this work for me?: >
    Elite works best for people that are 100% sure they have the entrepreneurial blood going throught their veins. The people that are hungry for success.<br><br>
    Besides that you also need to be able to dedicate at least 4-6 hours per week to your business, to see real significant growth.
- What products is this best for?: >
    There is most value if you're an early-stage startup, because the content is focused on getting you to ~$15.000-25.000 in monthly revenue quickly.<br><br>
    If you're already past that stage, some modules might be less interesting / relevant. If you want to work as a freelance growth consultant, you'll find the content very valuable, too.<br><b>Products that Elite works well for are:</b><br>
    - Software products (mobile apps, SaaS, etc.)<br>
    - eCommerce products / webshops<br>
    - Business-to-business products<br>
    - Traditional businesses... that want to expand their reach online<br>
    - Freelancers / consultants that want to work for any of the above sort of businesses
- Will this work for B2B startups?: >
    Yes, building growth loops works for Business-to-business startup, too. Other B2B companies that have benefitted massively from building growth loops in the past include:<br><br>
    - Hubspot<br>
    - Slack<br> 
    - Salesforce<br>
    - All sorts of SaaS products... <br>
    - ... and many, many more<br><br>
    While it used to be true that 'growth hacking' was mostly for consumer startups... that's simply no longer true if you use growth loops to grow. It works for B2B just as well.
