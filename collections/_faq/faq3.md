faq:
- Will I be able to work abroad after this course: >
    That really depends on the type of job you choose. Growth marketers are high in demand, so you can easily bargain an abroad position.<br><br>
    It is even easier if you start consulting. For me my living costs are way lower, and I earn as much as I would at home!
- Pieter, how did you gain this experience?: >
    I got my experience mostly through my previous startup ventures. I have been running 4 different businesses / products since I was 22 years old. So that's my background.<br><br>
    I worked in industries as varied as recruitment (B2B), selling consulting services, selling info-products (Growthcasts!), as well as mobile apps and SaaS products. <b>So I have a very broad base of experience, but always focused on early-stage startups: getting an idea to $20-50k in monthly revenue as soon as possible.</b>
- Can I get 1-on-1 support if I get stuck?: >
    <b>Yes, you can. I allocate time to helping 'my tribe' in 1-on-1 sessions.</b> You can always reach me by email if you need help. If you ever get really stuck with implementation, I will also help you out in 1-on-1 skype sessions.<br><br> 
    <b>To be clear...</b> all 1-on-1 time has to be within reason. I normally charge $5.000+ for consulting packages, so you'll still have to do most of the work yourself... but I'll help you get un-stuck if you get stuck anywhere. Also my team is available at any moment, if you need it.
- Is this an entire growth marketing blueprint?: >
    Yes, Growthcasts Elite lays out an entire step-by-step blueprint for building growth loops into the fabric of your business. <br><br>
    You will learn everything you need to know to do this: ranging from strategy and copywriting to tactical implementation tips and sales funnel hacks.
