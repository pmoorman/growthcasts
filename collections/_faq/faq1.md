- How does this course help my businesssss?: >
    Building Growth in your business is a scalable and save way to build your company. You'll also learn all the skills an entrepreneur needs.
- What previous experience is needed?: >
    Elite is an intermediate/advanced level course. It assumes you already have basic business experience. If you don't have much previous experience, you should be ready for an aggressive learning curve. <br><br>
    All modules start with a quick intro to cover the basics, but then go straight to intermediate and advanced strategies and tactics. It's not a 'marketing for dummies' course, by any means.
- Which practical skills will I learn?: >
    Elite covers mostly intermediate and advanced level skills, tactics and strategies. The main thing you'll learn is how you can create 'growth systems' such as growth engines, sales funnels and advanced onboarding flows. You then combine those into an entire 'growth loop', which drives engineered virality.<br>
    <b>Besides the strategies, you learn also practical skills, such as:</b>
    <br>
    * How to choose the best traction channels for a startup<br>
    * Which channels to use once you hit initial scale<br>
    * How you can take a marketing campaign (maybe Google ads, or content marketing, or SEO) from 'initial validation' to fast scaling<br>
    * How you write hard-hitting copy that actually gets people to buy<br>
    * How you create a 'risk roadmap' for ultimate focus,<br>
    * How you uncover hidden benefits, that strengthen your pitch & selling proposition<br>
    * ...and much, much more!<br>
    What you DON'T learn is all kind of technical skills (like advanced javascript programming), unless they are absolutely necessary.
- How much do growth marketers earn?: >
    It varies massively, but in places like the Bay Area a growth marketer with 2-3 years of experience will typically earn more than the developers he works with. Salaries range into the $120,000-150,000/year range (which is over $10,000/month), plus equity.<br><br>
    If you are - like me - in an area where there is less demand, you can probably earn more by working remotely. If you work for startups remotely you can probably expect to earn $70-90/hour with relative ease.<br><br>
    <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Buying this course does NOT imply that you will also automatically be entitelled to such rates.
