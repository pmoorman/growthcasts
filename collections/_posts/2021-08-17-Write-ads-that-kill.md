**Advertising used to be ruthless and beautiful.**

Ruthless, because basic processes like audience targeting, writing copy, and analysing results were slow, delicate affairs. And beautiful, because the rigamarole constrained the game to a few pros who served their audiences with delightful ads.

Today’s internet advertising arena is the opposite. Because anyone with $5 and a keyboard can participate, we face:
- An overload of poorly executed ads
- A public with a chronic case of ad fatigue

Luckily, nearly all mediocre ads share a common trait. You’re about to learn all about it, so you can do things differently.

#### **How to stand apart in a sea of low-quality ads**

It begins with understanding the arena.

Most advertisers are savvy enough to know they need *some* understanding of sales psychology to succeed. And that leads them to invest in either a few copywriting courses or a low-cost digital marketing service.

Together, these create a common theme:

*Most ad-writers are operating on a few copywriting basics. They can be likened to beginner photographers who’ve grasped the Rule of Thirds and treat it as an iron law for every photo.*

One of these copywriting fundamentals is usually helpful. But its overuse has turned it into a red flag that internet browsers use to spot and dodge ads:

*Speak to the reader as if you are engaging with them in a one-on-one conversation.*
 
 It's possible to create this feeling with both basic and advanced techniques. And here’s the crux of this article:

**Just about every advertiser is using the basic technique.**

It revolves around an element called narrative device - the point of view you use to speak to your reader.

Speaking directly to the reader with narrative device means using “you” language. Phrases like *“Imagine you’re…”*, *“You know what it’s like when…”*, or *"Does this happen to you, too?"*

With that in mind, take a second to think about this…

Social media platforms are blending ads with organic posts more and more. At the same time, most ads are of low quality. *This means readers can rely on recognising “you” language amongst posts to spot ads and move on.*  

#### **The solution? Learn the advanced ways of speaking directly to your audience**

We don’t need to use *narrative device* to give our readers the feeling of being spoken to directly.

Instead, we can tell stories that involve elements specific to *their* lives.
**For example**

If I was advertising a composition course to new photographers, I'd open a Facebook ad like this:

*John showed the classic sign of an amateur: All his questions were about my camera gear and exposure settings.*

*When I reviewed his photos, it was obvious what was holding him back:*

*He’d taken the “Rule of thirds” to heart and was using it wherever he could. His focus on it was preventing him from creating photos that left viewers feeling something.*

*I often meet photographers like John who are hung up about camera settings. Here’s the secret - those settings are just the accounting of photography. They’re admin.*

*Real photographic skill comes from the willingness to get into interesting situations to capture a moment.*

*Do you get me? It’s not about setup. It’s about daring to live.*

*I’ve distilled all my knowledge into a four-hour course that will change the way you see photography. Use the link below to learn all about it (and see some of my award-winning photos).*

*-Steve*

If I was advertising a distraction-free writing program to copywriters, I could begin an ad with:

*I am an undisciplined copywriter.*

*Within minutes of opening a new Google Doc, I'll open a new tab on autopilot.*

*Ten minutes later, I'll wake up to the fact that that I’m somehow browsing the Bitcoin subreddit...*

*When I was confronted by my CMO about my productivity, it wasn’t easy to tell her the truth - I was sure she would judge me as lazy. But, all she did was laugh and tell me to open a blank text document instead of my browser.*

*I gave it a go.*

*A few days of writing copy in Notepad later... I was a new writer.*

*It turns out that all I needed was an environment that made it easy to do the right thing.*

*With that said, Notepad left much to be desired.*

*I was forever copying, pasting, and reformatting.*

*And that’s what led me to chat with our developer about building a copywriter’s dream text editor...*

**Get the gist?**

Go on and try this approach with your ads. One beautiful consequence of our cheap advertising arena is that you can test bold approaches with few repercussions.

Dare to:

- Tell stories about interesting events and people, then tie them back to your offer
- Speak in terms of “we” and “they”, rather than “you”.

And if this article is showing you that you need new ads **now**... email [Pieter](mailto:pieter@doubleagency.com) and we’ll take care of it.
