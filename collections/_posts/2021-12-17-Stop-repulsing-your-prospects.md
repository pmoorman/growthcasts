**The jury is out, or is it?** Some people see us as tricksters. And others believe we’re downright *deceptive.* So, how did we marketers earn our reputation?

#### **One word: Repulsion**

The origins lie in an ugly, yet preventable dynamic that we can call *repulsion.*

Repulsion is that feeling in your stomach you get whenever a company seems to be pressuring you into something that’s good for them, but not necessarily good for you. It’s the sense that *you’re being pushed forward faster than you’re ready for.*

Repulsive touchpoints create *huge* drop-offs in conversions because they leave prospects feeling distrustful and suspicious. It should also come as no surprise that this is reflected in the bottom line:

- How likely are you to subscribe to a newsletter when you’re hit with a pop-up the moment you land on the website?

- How many times have you said, “Yes” to a salesperson who was *just checking* in to see if you were ready to buy?

#### **How do you design flows that avoid triggering the gag reflex?**

You offer a free newsletter subscription *after* providing exceptional value for free. You ask for the sale *after* addressing all of a prospect’s hesitations. 

With that said... how do you think your current funnels check out?

Fixing the issue is as simple as viewing your flows from the perspective of a customer and paying attention to your reactions. And if you’re too close to the product, you can just ask a friend.

#### **We love to buy. But we hate being sold to**

Put another way: *We love eating cookies. But we won’t enjoy the most delicious cookie in the world if it’s force-fed to us.*

This article teaches the art of seeing each customer touchpoint as a cookie offering… and how to make each one so appetising that prospects *voluntarily reach for them.*

#### **Cooperation is humanity’s secret weapon**

It turns a group of relatively weak, slow species into predators, tribes, and civilisations.

And because *nothing* in our lives works without cooperation, it makes sense that our brains are highly tuned to recognising whether a new person or group is likely to be a *contributor* or a *taker.*

We feel that instinct in action when someone asks for a favour (like a newsletter subscription) before they’ve first demonstrated their good intentions.

#### **How do you avoid triggering this reflex?**

Hey, we’re never ones to advise shortcuts, but if you’re in a rush, the quickest answer is to hire us!
