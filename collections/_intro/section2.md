At the core, growth marketing takes the question of “how can we get users”… and approaches it *like an engineer would.* The challenge is to build something scalable, durable, and automated. It’s not longer about cool creatives or profitable ad campaigns like in traditional marketing—you need to build *a machine (or process, or system, or whatever you want to call it…)* to bring in new users, virtually on autopilot.

This is done through loops. One cohort of users today… needs to bring in another cohort of users, tomorrow. And then *that cohort* needs to brings in *the next cohort,* and on and on… in an infinite cycle that creates new customers at every turn. 

There are over 25 different such loops, and each of them can apply to different kinds of products and businesses. But let’s take two examples, to get you going…

<br>
<blockquote>
<span class="underline underline--short"><b>USG-SEO loops</b><br></span>
  Products like Yelp or Reddit execute on a USG-SEO loop: users create content, which gets ranked by Google (mostly for long-tail keywords), and that content brings new users into the platform, so the loop repeats. User-generated content forms the beating heart of this machine.

<blockquote>
<span class="underline underline--short"><b>“Powered by” loop</b><br></span>
  You know that Intercom widget on millions of sites, don’t you? Whenever a company uses Intercom, they expose their live chat widget on their website. The widget simply says *“Powered by Intercom”*, and brings new users in touch with Intercom.
</blockquote>

Taking that approach, you flip the script on what marketing is all about: Suddenly your job is no longer to *“get customers”*, but rather to engineer a loop that *automatically* gets more customers in, creating those positive feedback loops. And the funny thing is…

### This works as well for venture-backed SaaS companies as it does for a lone *‘digital nomad’*, operating a lifestyle business from the beaches of Bali…

And I can know, because I do just that!

For me, this journey started when I had lost my previous startup. I was living in paradise, but I felt like a failure. While *living* in Bali was fun, it wasn’t a sustainable solution without a business that earns money.


Things needed to change around, if I wanted to stay living here.
And if you’re with your back against the wall, and you NEED to make business a success, only one thing matters…


<blockquote><i>Getting enough customers to pay the bills!</i></blockquote>

No customers, and I’d have to go back to Holland, and find myself a boring office job.
