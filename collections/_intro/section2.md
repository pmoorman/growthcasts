At the core, growth marketing takes the question of *“how can we get users”…* and approaches it *like an engineer would.* The challenge is to build something scalable, durable, and automated. It’s not longer about cool creatives or profitable ad campaigns like in traditional marketing—you need to build *a machine (or process, or system, or whatever you want to call it…)* to bring in new users, virtually on autopilot.

This is done through loops. One cohort of users today… needs to bring in another cohort of users, tomorrow. And then *that cohort* needs to brings in *the next cohort,* and on and on… in an infinite cycle that creates new customers at every turn. 

There are over 25 different such loops, and each of them can apply to different kinds of products and businesses. But let’s take two examples, to get you going…

<blockquote>
<span class="underline underline--short" style="font-size: 115%;"><b>USG-SEO loops</b></span><br style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
  Products like Yelp or Reddit execute on a USG-SEO loop: users create content, which gets ranked by Google (mostly for long-tail keywords), and that content brings new users into the platform, so the loop repeats. User-generated content forms the beating heart of this machine.

<blockquote>
<span class="underline underline--short" style="font-size: 115%;"><b>“Powered by” loop</b></span><br style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
  You know that Intercom widget on millions of sites, don’t you? Whenever a company uses Intercom, they expose their live chat widget on their website. The widget simply says <i>“Powered by Intercom”</i>, and brings new users in touch with Intercom.

### Growth loops work for both venture-backed companies and lone *‘digital nomads’*, operating a lifestyle business from Bali…

And I can know, because I do just that!

For me, this journey started when I had lost my previous startup. I was living in paradise, but I felt like a failure. While *living* in Bali was fun, it wasn’t a sustainable solution without a business that earns money.
