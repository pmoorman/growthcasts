And damnit... that's a complicated question! Getting people to adopt your product is stupidly hard. <span class="c--black t--bold">Here’s why so many of us struggle with selling</span>: most entrepreneurs are fundamentally builders and hustlers. We love creating stuff out of nothing.

And that’s great. The world needs creators and ruckus makers like that! That drive to build stuff is often the very motivation that got us started as entrepreneurs in the first place.  But inevitably — soon after you ship the product — you (or worse, your impatient Seed investors) start asking...

{: .handwriting .c--black}
"How do I get people to use this thing?"

{: .list}
- What can we do to hit those growth targets we’ve set for yourselves?
- How can I get a steady stream of people signing up?
- How can we get more revenue, so we can hire a better team?
- How can we 5X the revenue this year… so we can finally pay all the bills?

And we tell ourselves “ah, that’ll be fine. We’ll figure it out!”… but chances are you won’t figure it out. It’s stupidly hard. As a matter of fact... <span class="t--bold c--black">Most startups fail because they can’t get enough customers.</span>

Trust me, I know how you feel: When you’ve got a great product and you’re anxious to scale and you’re being told to “Do things that don’t scale” it’s like, “Dude. At this rate, I’ll be in a wheelchair before I do big numbers.”
We all know that it’s important to build the right product, get customer feedback, work on your positioning, etc. etc. Bu...

Chances are you don’t want to do small numbers forever. It sucks to be living off of a small founder’s salary for the next 10 years. You are not building a part-time side project. You wanted to build a startup! Something that can grow. You want to GO FAST!

And that’s when you’ll realise — just like I did — that just "being a hustler" isn’t good enough. Getting 10 customers here, and 15 there… doesn’t cut it anymore! It’s time to kick into the next gear. You want to hit “growth stage”. And of course, that means you'll need to close 100s (of not thousands) of paying customers, every single month. Because that’s what growth looks like.

So. Back to you.
<p class="t--bold c--black">Maybe you’ve found yourself at a similar crossroad...</p>

Maybe it’s time you learn how the fastest growing startups actually drive their growth, so you can replicate the framework that they use. Imagine for a second…
