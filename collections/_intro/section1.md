It’s David Packard who said that⏤one of the founders of Hewlett-Packard, and among the greatest entrepreneurs of the last century.

He’s honing in on the essence of entrepreneurship and business. And at the core is a rather humbling, simple truth… 


<blockquote class="handwriting handwriting--primary"><br>Businesses exist to<i> help customers succeed</i></blockquote>

Whether you’re selling lemonade on a hot day, or building the next Google… you need to bring solutions to people with problems. The more people you make happy, the more you’ll earn.

That means there are only **two basic functions in business:** 1) to make products that solve real problems, and 2) to get as many people as possible to use it, so you can make them happy. 

And that’s where marketing comes in…
<br><br>
### Marketing is important—because even with a great product, the world will not automatically beat a path to your door

Every day startups with amazing products close their doors and disappear… because they couldn’t get enough users, and because they couldn’t explain their vision well enough.
<br><br>
<blockquote><i><b>Customers are the lifeblood of your business.<br>
They are the reason your product exists!
</b></i></blockquote>

Getting more customers is the hardest—but also most important—thing in business… and unlocking profitable and scalable acquisition channels is the most important milestone towards product/market-fit and starting the growth phase of your business. 

But as it turns out…
<br><br>
### The way marketing works has changed dramatically...

Marketing for early-stage startup companies has *nothing to do* with marketing as you traditionally know it. What works for big companies, doesn’t work for early-stage startups. That is why  “growth hacking” popped up. 

But what used to be called “growth hacking” has changed a lot over the last few years—it’s no longer about hacks as much as a much bigger umbrella of professionalized frameworks. 

What we have now is a set of complete, mature frameworks to drive explosive product growth… 
***without depending on traditional marketing, ever again!***
