The few elite marketers that actually *know* how to build billion-dollar startup companies… they approach the question of “how to get customers” *profoundly* different than what any marketing guru ever talks about…

So I did what they did. I started messing around with the things they do: I tested the way they structure their funnels. I “reverse-engineered” the way they build traffic systems (called “growth engines”). I started applying their ruthless testing and prioritization regimes.

After a while I started to notice their channel strategies. The psychological triggers they pull. The copywriting.

But I always had one simple objective in mind…
<br><br>
### “Can I turn their strategies into something that a single entrepreneur like me can execute?”

<ul>
	<li>Can I find a framework that works to get my first 100 customers (rather than 10 million customers like *they* talk about)?</li>
	<li>Can I simplify it, so it’ll work for eCommerce, and SaaS and mobile apps… all the same?</li>
	<li>How can you apply their onboarding strategies, if you’re A) not a developer and B) strapped for cash?</li>
</ul>

And so on. 
I was experimenting, testing and writing notes. 

What I found was a simple, 6-part framework that I could easily execute against. It was practical, simple and focused. It fits on the back of a napkin. 

You've seen the outline before…

When I saw that it was working for my own two companies, I got curious if it would work for others, too. That turned into a few consulting gigs, and…
<br><br>
### The results were *extra-ordinary*

As a growth marketing consultant, I was able to help 4 startups scale *incredibly well.* All within less than 2 years: 

  – One company raised $20MM+ in funding
  – Another company got acquired
  – Another 2 companies achieved profitability, and kept scaling

Of course, those consulting gigs paid incredibly well. I was doing all the work while sitting in Bali or traveling the world… *yet the results kept rolling in.*

I started to document everything. To create a “playbook”. Friends started using this system too… and they got excellent results. Today, that 6-part system has turned into our flagship product, called **“Growthcasts Elite”**. It’s a premium offering, that every entrepreneur can us himself, to learn these skills.

So, I want to introduce you to something exciting…
