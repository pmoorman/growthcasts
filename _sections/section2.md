Actually, maybe "revelation" is a bit of a big word. It was more like: “I got lucky”.

**How?**

In the months prior... I stumbled on a keynote presentation by Brian Balfour, where he talks about growth marketing.

Watch it (or just the first few minutes...). It’s important, because it frames EVERYTHING else you’ll read on this page.

This guy is not your typical marketing guru. Brian Balfour is the former “VP of Growth” at Hubspot, one of the biggest tech startups in the world.

Duh! What got you here… won’t get you there! So what’s the difference?

Systems thinking.

Instead in “hacks”, you need a scalable, repeatable process… to bring hundreds of people in the door, and turn them into happy, paying customers. You need some sort of a “acquisition machine” (or process, or system, or whatever you want to call it) that does the work for you.

You need a system that can scale your growth.

Think about it.

Taking that approach, completely flips the script on what marketing is all about. Suddenly your job is no longer to “get customers”, but rather to “build a little machine, that gets customers for us — on autopilot.”

If you’re thinking, “Good for them...”

...Here’s why I’m telling you all this:
