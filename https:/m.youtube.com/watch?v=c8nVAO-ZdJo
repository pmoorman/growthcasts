Big O is a notation used to express the time complexity of an algorithm as
a function of the number of inputs (`n`). That is, in terms of `n`, how
many simple operations does the algorithm perform?
A brute force search of an unsorted array happens in linear time. That
is, if there are 1000 elements in the array (`n = 1000`), the number of
simple operations that need to happen is a linear function of `n`.

- Big-O introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watchv=__vX2sjlpXU&list=PL9xmBV_5YoZMxejjIyFHWa-4nKg6sdoIv
- Big O analysis and cheatsheet: http://bigocheatsheet.com/ 

If GitHub doesn't render the notebook use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/. I'll eventually just set up README's with links in each directory of type of algorithm.
# Algorithms types considered below:
 - Simple recursive algorithms
 - Backtracking algorithms
 - Divide and conquer algorithms
 - Dynamic programming algorithms
